# STM Remote Knob Controller
Over the summer of 2016 I worked with the Gupta group in the Physics Research Building at The Ohio State University. While there, I applied and expanded my engineering skills by designing and building an apparatus for the remote control of a scanning tunneling microscope.

Below is a picture of the high-voltage amplifier used for controlling the probe tip of the research groupâ€™s microscope:

This is what I created:
